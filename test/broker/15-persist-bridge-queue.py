# Start two brokers one bridging forward to the second one (the bridge target).
# Once brokers are up and running we stop the bridge target broker, connect
# a publisher an publish a number of qos1 messages.
# Check all the messages should bestored in the persistence store.
# Afterwards start the bridge target broker, connect a client and
# add a matching subscription. Then start the bridging broker and check,
# if all messages are forwarded from the persistence store to bridge target
# and further to the subscriber.
# Finally check the persistence store contains zero messages.
